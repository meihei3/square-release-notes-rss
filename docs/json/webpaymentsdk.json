        "details": "## Secure context requirement\n\nStarting October 1, 2025, the Web Payments SDK requires all integrations to run in secure contexts (HTTPS). To ensure uninterrupted service:\n- Migrate your integration to HTTPS before the deadline.\n- Test your secure implementation thoroughly.\n- For guidance about implementing secure contexts, see Mozilla's [Secure Contexts](https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/Security\/Secure_Contexts) documentation.\n\n## ACH:\n**Error handling update** - The error condition previously indicated by [PlaidMissingNameError](https:\/\/developer.{{SQUARE_DOMAIN}}\/reference\/sdks\/web\/payments\/errors\/PlaidMissingNameError) is now signaled using [InvalidOptionError](https:\/\/developer.{{SQUARE_DOMAIN}}\/reference\/sdks\/web\/payments\/errors\/InvalidOptionError). While `PlaidMissingNameError` remains in the SDK for backward compatibility, Square recommends updating your error handling logic to catch `InvalidOptionError` for this scenario. The `PlaidMissingNameError` will no longer be emitted by the SDK.\n\n## Apple Pay:\nThe email address (`email`) and phone number (`phone`) are now available as a part of tokenization results in [TokenResult.TokenDetails.BillingContact](https:\/\/developer.{{SQUARE_DOMAIN}}\/reference\/sdks\/web\/payments\/objects\/ApplePay#ApplePay.tokenize.Promise%3CTokenResult%3E.TokenResult.details.TokenDetails.billing.BillingContact).\n\n### Miscellaneous:\nThe [PaymentRequestEvent](https:\/\/developer.{{SQUARE_DOMAIN}}\/reference\/sdks\/web\/payments\/enums\/PaymentRequestEvent) and [MethodType](https:\/\/developer.{{SQUARE_DOMAIN}}\/reference\/sdks\/web\/payments\/enums\/MethodType) types has been updated to return a string union rather than an enumeration.",

For more information about creating a secure context in your application, read the Mozilla [Secure contexts](https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/Security\/Secure_Contexts) article.\n\n## Accessibility improvements\nSignificant improvements have been made to enhance the accessibility of the payment forms, ensuring a better experience for users who rely on screen readers and assistive technologies.\n\n- All payment iframes now include fully accessible titles.\n- All payment fields offer fully accessible validation messages.\n- Postal code input is now hidden from screen readers when the field is visually hidden on the card form.\n- Aria-invalid is only set on `tokenize()`.\n- The card brand icon is made accessible to screen readers.\n- ApplePay documentation recommends the use of the `<button>` tag for clickable Apple Pay elements.\n\n## Reliability improvements\nError handling is strengthened across multiple payment methods, focusing on common edge cases in Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Cash App Pay integrations.\n\n- Improved error handling when Google Pay is canceled.\n- Improved error handling when Apple Pay is used with a delay between a button click and a `tokenize()` call.\n- Improved error handling for buyer verification.\n- Improved error handling when Apple Pay is initialized from an insecure HTTP context.\n- Improved error handling when Cash App Pay is initialized with an invalid redirect URL.\n\n## Miscellaneous changes\nSeveral technical updates have been made to streamline ACH configuration, modify token status responses, and update credit card form appearance.\n\n- The `ach()` method no longer requires a `redirectURI` option and the `transactionId` option is optional.\n- The token status types have been updated to return a string rather than an unusable enumeration.\n- The credit card form has been updated to use a monospaced font variant.",
